**Welcome to the GSSO Research Hub Community**

The GSSO Research Hub Community is a key part of a grant-funded initiative to advance Digital Research Alliance of Canad (DRA) for equity-oriented digital health systems and standards. Our work focuses on modernizing gender, sex, and sexual orientation (GSSO) information practices within digital health systems, including electronic health records (EHRs), patient portals, and lab information systems. Guided by principles of inclusivity, collaboration, and sustainability, this project aligns with Canada Health Infoway's Action Plan to Modernize GSSO Information Practices in Canadian EHRs.

**Mission and Objectives**

The GSSO Research Hub has been established to:

-   Co-create equity-oriented digital health standards and practices that address systemic inequities.
-   Evaluate and monitor the integration of modernized GSSO practices in digital health systems.
-   Build a collaborative, transdisciplinary research community that values diverse perspectives, including those with lived and living experiences.
-   Disseminate lessons learned and best practices to equity-deserving groups, professional organizations, and broader research networks.

**How We Work**

The GSSO Research Hub operates through collaborative engagement and shared decision-making. Participants from academic, professional, and community sectors contribute their expertise to co-create tools and methods for advancing equity in digital health. Regular, secure meetings provide a space for feedback, discussion, and the refinement of research outputs. Documentation of progress and outcomes ensures transparency and supports sustainability.

**Principles and Standards**

This community is guided by key principles rooted in Open Life Science Standards:

-   **Openness**: We strive to make all research outputs---including data, tools, and findings---openly available whenever possible to maximize accessibility and impact.
-   **Collaboration**: Participants engage in inclusive, transparent, and participatory processes that prioritize shared decision-making and equitable representation.
-   **Equity and Inclusion**: Special focus is placed on creating a safe, respectful environment for all members, particularly those from equity-deserving groups such as Indigenous Peoples, 2SLGBTQQIA+ individuals, and women.
-   **Sustainability**: Practices are designed for long-term usability, with clear documentation and accessible tools that support ongoing innovation and application.

**How to Get Involved**

Participation in the GSSO Research Hub Community is open to individuals and organizations committed to advancing equity in digital health. Opportunities to engage include:

-   **Community Meetings**: Join regular meetings to review progress, provide feedback, and discuss priorities for action.
-   **Collaborative Research**: Contribute to the development and evaluation of GSSO practices and standards.
-   **Training and Knowledge Sharing**: Participate in or support training sessions on DRI tools and equity-oriented practices.
-   **Outreach and Advocacy**: Help disseminate findings and promote inclusive digital health systems through professional networks.

**Ethos**

The GSSO Research Hub Community is committed to fostering a respectful and inclusive environment. All participants are expected to:

-   Treat others with respect and dignity.
-   Avoid discriminatory, harassing, or harmful behavior.
-   Uphold the principles of openness, collaboration, and equity in all community activities.

Please see our full Code of Conduct for more details.

**Resources and Documentation**

The following resources are available to support community engagement and collaboration:

-   **Training Modules**: Access training on DRI tools (e.g., Lunaris, FRDR) and best practices for equitable digital health systems.
-   **Community Updates**: Summaries of meetings, project milestones, and evaluation findings shared with participants.
-   **Knowledge Repository**: A curated collection of publications, tools, and data supporting the implementation of GSSO practices.
