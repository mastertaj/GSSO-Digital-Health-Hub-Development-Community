If someone asks you to stop any unwelcome behavior, you must stop immediately.

**Diversity Statement**

We honor and celebrate diversity in all its forms, including but not limited to age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and ability.

We actively work to create a space where all participants feel valued, heard, and supported.
